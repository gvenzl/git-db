To extend Git DB with other databases you will have to do the following:

1) Create a new entry for the database in the git_db_configuration.py enumeration called Database
2) Create a new file for your database under "python/database/<database>.py"
3) Provide a class "Database in "python/database/<database>.py" with the following methods:

    def setup(self, all_schemas) # called by git db init

    def remove(self) # called by git db deinit

    def get_uncommitted_changes(self) # called by git db status

    def get_added_changes(self) # called by git db status

    def get_commit_log(self, verbose) # called by git db log

    def add_changes(self, name, user, owner, db_object) # called by git db add

    def set_commit_id(self, commit_id) # called by git db commit

    def set_tag(self, tag, commit_id) # called by git db tag

    def reset_changes(self, name, user, owner, db_object) # called by git db reset
